Your helpful friend ðŸ“Žfor launching an ICO

Dependencies
  * https://github.com/trufflesuite/ganache-cli
  * https://github.com/ethereum/mist

Run `ganache-cli`

Then connect Mist with `/Applications/Mist.app/Contents/MacOS/Mist --rpc http://localhost:8545`

Now go to this repo, and run

`truffle compile`

and then

`truffle migrate`

Take note of the contract address generated. In Mist, go to "Watch Contract" and paste in that address. You'll also have to copy the ABI field of the generated JSON from under build/contracts/TokenERC20.json and paste that in. Give it a name like Mikancoin.

You'll be able to see the ICO token interface and run commands against it.
